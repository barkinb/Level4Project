This present study aims to investigate students’ difficulties in solving the probabilistic problem. It focuses on analyzing and describing students errors during solving the problem. This research used the qualitative method with case study strategy. The subjects in this research involve ten students of 9th grade that were selected by purposive sampling. Data in this research involve students’ probabilistic problem-solving result and recorded interview regarding students’ difficulties in solving the problem. Those data were analyzed descriptively using Miles and Huberman steps. The results show that students have difficulties in solving the probabilistic problem and can be divided into three categories. First difficulties relate to students’ difficulties in understanding the probabilistic problem. Second, students’ difficulties in choosing and using appropriate strategies for solving the problem. Third, students’ difficulties with the computational process in solving the problem. Based on the result seems that students still have difficulties in solving the probabilistic problem. It means that students have not able to use their knowledge and ability for responding probabilistic problem yet. Therefore, it is important for mathematics teachers to plan probabilistic learning which could optimize students probabilistic thinking ability.},

	abstract = {Background:  Small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is a surgical procedure for the refractive correction of myopia and astigmatism, which has been reported as safe and effective. However, over- and under-correction still occur after SMILE. The neces‑sity of nomograms is emphasized to achieve optimal refractive results. Ophthalmolo‑gists diagnose nomograms by analyzing the preoperative refractive data with their individual knowledge which they accumulate over years of experience. Our aim was to predict the nomograms of sphere, cylinder, and astigmatism axis for SMILE accurately by applying machine learning algorithm.
Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed the data of 3,034 eyes composed of four categorical features and 28 numerical features selected from 46 features. The multiple linear regression, decision tree, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and multi-layer perceptron were employed in developing the nomogram models for sphere, cylinder, and astigmatism axis. The scores of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and accuracy were evaluated and compared. Subsequently, the feature importance of the best models was calculated.
Results:  AdaBoost achieved the highest performance with RMSE of 0.1378, 0.1166, and 5.17 for the sphere, cylinder, and astigmatism axis, respectively. The accuracies of which error below 0.25 D for the sphere and cylinder nomograms and 25° for the astigmatism axis nomograms were 0.969, 0.976, and 0.994, respectively. The feature with the highest importance was preoperative manifest refraction for all the cases of nomograms. For the sphere and cylinder nomograms, the following highly important feature was the surgeon.
Conclusions:  Among the diverse machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost exhibited the highest performance in the prediction of the sphere, cylinder, and astigmatism axis nomograms for SMILE. The study proved the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence (AI) to nomograms for SMILE. Also, it may enhance the quality of the surgical result of SMILE by providing assistance in nomograms and preventing the misdiagnosis in nomograms.},

The resulting graphs are called nomograms, alignment charts, or abacs.

However, nomography declined by the end of the twentieth century with the development and popularisation of more capable and powerful personal computers and handheld calculators. Despite this context, nomography remains attractive due to its potential for rapid and accurate graphical calculations contributing to a better understanding of complex formulas. Thus, this work defines the alignment charts and their capabilities to justify their importance as graphical tools in sciences and engineering studies. Also, PyNomo software is introduced to build vector-based and scalable nomograms. Then, this work emphasizes the importance of including nomography as a valuable and renewed computational tool, in conjunction with PyNomo software, in an academic context. In line with that, several nomograms, which have been obtained with PyNomo software, are examined to grasp the true importance of this science branch and its capabilities in an educational context.},

To make inferences through physical imagery, people must represent  information that coordinates the interactions among the imagined objects. The  current research contrasts two proposals for how this coordinating information is  realized in physical imagery. In the traditional kinematic formulation, imagery  transformations are coordinated by geometric information in analog spatial  representations. In the dynamic formulation, transformations may also be  regulated by analog representations of force and resistance. Four experiments  support the dynamic formulation. They show, for example, that without making  changes to the spatial properties of a problem, dynamic perceptual information  (e.g., torque) and beliefs about physical properties (e. g., viscosity) affect  the inferences that people draw through imagery. The studies suggest that  physical imagery is not so much an analog of visual perception as it is an analog  of physical action. A simple model that represents force as a rate helps explain  why inferences can emerge through imagined actions even though people may not  know the answer explicitly. It also explains how and when perception, beliefs,  and learning can influence physical imagery.},

With this model, we demonstrated how a nomogram helps scientists and managers interpret interactions among variables, compare the relative biological importance of variables, and examine predicted shapes of relationships (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear) between response and predictor variables. Although our example focused on logistic regression, nomograms are equally useful for other linear and nonlinear models.

	abstract = {The theoretical concept of a perfect thermal radiator, the blackbody, was first introduced by the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff in 1860. By the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become the object of intense theoretical and experimental investigation. While an attempt at trying to theoretically understand the behavior of radiation emitted from a blackbody was undertaken by many eminent physicists of the day, its solution was not found until 1900 when Max Planck put forward his now famous law for thermal radiation. Today, of course, understanding blackbody behavior is vitally important to many fields including infrared systems, illumination, pyrometry, spectroscopy, astronomy, thermal engineering, cryogenics, and meteorology. Mathematically, the form Planck’s law takes is rather cumbersome meaning calculations made with it before the advent of modern computers were rather tedious, dramatically slowing the process of computation. Fortunately, during those early days of the twentieth century researchers quickly realized Planck’s equation, and the various functions closely related to it, readily lend themselves to being given a graphical, mechanical, or numerically tabulated form for their evaluation. The first of these computational aids to appear were tables. These arose shortly after Planck introduced his equation, were produced in the greatest number, and remained unsurpassed in their level of accuracy compared to all other aids made. It was also not long before nomograms designed to aid thermal radiation calculations appeared. Essentially a printed chart and requiring nothing more than a straightedge to use, nomograms were cheap and extremely easy to use. Facilitating instant answers to a range of quantities relating to thermal radiation, a number were produced and the inventiveness displayed in some was quite remarkable. In this paper we consider the historical development of many of the nomograms and tables developed and used by generations of scientists and engineers before their sudden and irrevocable decline shortly after the arrival of affordable digital computers and hand-held electronic calculators during the mid-1970s. This work represents a continuation of our earlier work on a number of radiation slide rules developed and used for thermal radiation calculations, with all three of these computational aids being the subject of a forthcoming book.},

	abstract = {The 'nomogram' diagram was used by L.J. Henderson to describe the physical-chemical system of blood as part of his analysis into mammalian blood in the early twentieth century. 'Nomography' was developed by Maurice d'Ocagne in 1899, enabling more variables and the expression of all the parameters of a formula on one chart which can be read by lining up a straight edge along the scale.;Upon attempting to analyze mammalian blood as a chemical substance, scientist L. J. Henderson found the only way he could describe so complicated a chemical system was through what he termed a "nomogram." Hankins relays the history of Henderson's nomograms and the origins of graphs in the eighteenth century.;L. J. Henderson, a Harvard physiologist and the first president of the History of Science Society, attempted to analyze mammalian blood solely as a physical-chemical substance. He found that the only way he could describe a chemical system as complicated as blood was by a diagram called a "nomogram." This lecture tells the history of Henderson's nomogram and of nomograms in general. It describes the origins of graphs in the eighteenth century, their development in nineteenth-century engineering practice, and their importance in the twentieth century for describing physical and chemical systems.;},
